# Worldwide_covid_tracking

Hello everyone, my name is Ujwol :)

Today Iâ€™m going to do a follow-along SQL portfolio project from the YouTuber Alex the Analyst. This part one project performs some data exploration with basic SQL queries that involves statements like SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, and window functions. Alex uses a worldwide covid tracking dataset on: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths .
